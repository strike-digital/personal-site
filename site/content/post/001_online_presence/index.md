Unfortunately, as a creative, you also have to create an online presence.
So buckle up, because you're about the learn how. -->


### Recuiters are like Ostriches

If they can't see you, you don't exist.

This is generally considered a bad thing if you want to be hired, as existing is usually listed under the "*what we're looking for in a candidate*" section of a job posting.
Keeping this in mind, as a creative, you should probably be looking to increase your visibility as much as possible, and creating an extensive online presence is a pretty good way to achieve that.
This post will guide you through the treacherous waters of doing so, avoiding the shipwrecks, stormy weather and sea monsters of mediorcrity, and hopefully navigating to the glittering harbours of getting a job. So with our metaphors thoroughly muddled, lets get to it.

### How to stand out? Don't.

Instead, focus on casting your net wide.

To clarify, consider this: There are 8 billion people on this planet. That is an unfathomable number.
If you met one new person every hour, 24 hours a day, from when you were born to the day you die, you would have made it through just over half a percent of all the people alive today.
It is a statistical fact that there is someone out there who is more creative than you, someone who can work faster than you, someone who can draw more beautifully, model more precisely and animate more elegantly than you. Depressing, right?


However, this is not necessarily a bad thing. Think about how many people
<!-- Be good. This is probably the most important step. You can be the most likable person in the world, but if your work isn't good, tough luck bucko, you're not getting hired.

Once that's done though, you've completed the hard bit, and all you need to worry about is getting as many people as possible to know that you exist. Consider it this way: there are 8 billion people on this planet. -->
<!-- This is not ideal if you want to be hired, as existing is generally one of the prerequisites.
Lucky for you, however, we invented the internet, which in this metaphor is like a shop where you can buy large signs saying "*Ostrich Food Here!*" in a large typeface.
However, this shop also sells unrelated signs and there are also millions of other people who want the ostrich to notice them, so if you want to attract attention, you need a sign that will stand out from the crowd.
Something like " "*Hot Ostriches Near You*" -->
