## Does the concept of professionalism apply to the creative industries?

In a word, Yes.

## In more than a word

From Aristotle to Steven Segal, the greatest minds in humanities long history have pondered what it takes to be a true Professional in the creative industries.
Is it the ability to conquer your foes, crush them to dust and then drink wine from their skulls? That's probably what Genghis Kahn would say.
Or is it the ability to work peacfully to achieve our goals, as Ghandi would probably have proclaimed?

Indeed if any of these great historical features had access to LinkedIn, you could be sure that that would lose no time at all in sending these opinions whizzing into our eyeholes via the medium of an inspirational post.

The Cambridge dictionary defines professionalism as:

> [Professionalism](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/professionalism)
> (/prəˈfeʃ.ən.əl.ɪ.zəm/)
>
> the combination of all the qualities that are connected with trained and skilled people

From this we can conclude that Genghis Kahn was indeed a professional, and as such was an expert in the concept of professionalism.
